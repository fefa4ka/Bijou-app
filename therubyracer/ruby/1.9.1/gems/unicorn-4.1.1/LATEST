=== unicorn 4.1.1 - fix last-resort timeout accuracy / 2011-08-25 21:30 UTC

  The last-resort timeout mechanism was inaccurate and often
  delayed in activation since the 2.0.0 release.  It is now fixed
  and remains power-efficient in idle situations, especially with
  the wakeup reduction in MRI 1.9.3+.

  There is also a new document on application timeouts
  intended to discourage the reliance on this last-resort
  mechanism.  It is visible on the web at:
